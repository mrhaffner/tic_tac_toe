//You’re going to store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object, so start there!

//Try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory. Rule of thumb: 
//if you only ever need ONE of something (gameBoard, displayController), use a module. 
//If you need multiples of something (players!), create them with factories.



//Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage 
//(for now you can just manually fill in the array with "X"s and "O"s)
//let square1, square2, square3, square4, square5, square6, square7, square8, square9; 
//for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
//    `square${i}` = document.getElementById(`square${i}`);
//};

//Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, 
//and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. 
//Don’t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
    //Think carefully about where each bit of logic should reside. 
    //Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects.. 
    //but take care to put them in “logical” places. Spending a little time brainstorming here can make your life much easier later!

//Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.



//Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, 
//include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!
